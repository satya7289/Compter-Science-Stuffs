 
 In this course we will be having programming assignments. Python is the best rapid prototyping language used for ML applications. Python provides numerous packages to read data, process data, train ML models, and display results. 
You are expected to familiarize yourself with the most useful packages in Python. 
Pandas library offers a set of power datastructures and supported operations to manipulate data. 
You should use Google Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) for executing your code. 
Familiarize yourself with the DataFrame object.  
Explore how to 
1) Use Python lists and dictionaries. How to do slicing of lists using the colon (:) specifications. 
2) Create a DataFrame object from the data loaded from a dataset. 
3) Print various rows and columns of the dataset. 
4) Print a subset of rows and a subset of columns
5) How to group (aggregate) specific columns that correspond to certain specific values of rows. (use DataFrame.groupby())
