```
Implement a handwritten digit classifier using a neural network. 
You can use available routines in Scikit-Learn or Tensorflow to program the neural network. 
Fix an appropriate architecture and experiment with different batch sizes. 
Generate new training images by flipping the white and black pixels. That means, the foreground which was originally black will now become white and the background which was originally white will now become black. 
Now prepare batches which have equal number of original and the corresponding flipped images. 
Plot the training error vs update step for every experiment. 
```

### Instruction to run the program
- Step1: Install the depencies like sklearn, matplotlib, numpy, python
- Step2: python main.py
